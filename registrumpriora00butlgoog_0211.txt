be observed’that Balydowel is here said to be a Manerium.

Ricardus de Plumea—Adam de Feipo was one of Hugh de Lacy’s barone, and had a
grant of Serius, Clontorht (Clontarf)‚ and Santrest, which brought him into con-
tact with the grants to All-Hauows. In 1332 Simon de Feypo was seised of the
manors of Skryne in Meath‚ of Santry in Dublin‚ and of Rathcoul and Moyeshell in
the Liberty of Trim.—Pipe Roll. Of the introduction of the name of Simon into
this family the following account is given in the Miracula Simonis de Montfort,
printed by the Camden Society: “ Ricardus Seypo (Feypo) miles Hiberniae, habuit
mulierem pregnantem et febricitantem et propter moesticiam et dolorem perdidit
loquelam. Physici desperaverunt et dixerunt, ‘ Aut peribit puer aut mater.’ Post
paululum versa est ad vomitum, et peperit masculum elegantem sed abortivum.
Dictus Ricardus plicuit denarium ad martirem nostrum, super matrem et puerum,
et revixit puer, et sanata est mater, et dederant nomen Simon de Montfort .....
Testes hujus rei dictus Ricardus cum tota familia sua.''—p. 73. How Feypo‚ lord
of Santry, had acquired authority over these men of Baldoyle‚ does not appear. It
would be hasty to conclude, from this charter‚ that it was possible in Ireland‚ as we
know that it was in Scotland‚ for a person to be tenant to one party and native to
another, a complicated relationship, which must have been full of difficulties—RQ.
