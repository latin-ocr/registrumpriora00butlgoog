in which it was executed witnessed a very different scene. There,
on the 16th November, 1538, in the presence of sundry persons, in a
deed giving proof of the compulsion under which it was executed
by the vehemence of the declaratione of their free will, Walter
Hancoke, Prior, Robert Dolyng, John Grogan‚ J ames Blake, and John
Barret, the last Prior and the last Canons of All Hallows, assembled
for the last time, and there signed‚ sealed, and delivered, to the
Royal CommissionerS, William Brabazon‚ Gerald Ailmer‚ John Allen,
and Robert Fitzsimon‚ all hungry for monastic spoil‚ the surrender
of their ancient priory. The form of surrender then executed

and services, mille, meadows and pastureS, woods and underwoods,
houses, buildings, grangeS‚ granaries, stables and dovecots, fisherieS,
warrens, annuitieS, waters, ponde, rectorieS, vicarageS, knights’ feeS‚
advowsons of churches, chapels, and chantries‚ pensione, porcione,
tithes, oblatione, courts leet, and of frank pledge, and their profits and
perquisiteS, and all other rights, possessione, and hereditamentS, as
well spiritual as temporal, in the counties os Dublin, Meath, Kildare‚
Louth‚ Tipperary, Kilkenny‚ and elsewhere in Ireland‚ belonging in
any way to the Prior and Canons of All Hallows. Nor were these

all these were granted to the King, to be disposed of at his good
pleasure‚ without appeal or complaint, and the unhappy men were
forced to declare, that they thus deprived themselves of house and
home of their own free will, and that they put an end to a venera-
ble institution, to which they were bound by the most solemn obli-
gatione, certain just and reasonable causes thereto moving their

minds and their conscienceS.
