title perhaps not known to the Dublin ecclesiastice of the fifteenth century, and which
they certainly would be unwilling to recognize out of the line of the Dublin prelacy‚
but which was borne by Ferdomnach‚ Bishop of Kildare, about the year 1096 (U sserii
Sylloge, p. 93), and by other bishops of that see, and which, during the supremacy os
Del-mod, may possibly have been assumed by his Bishop of Ferus. The Bishop of
Ferus at this time was J oseph O’Hethe, or O’AEdha-Ware’s Bishops. If his Chris-
tian name had been Aed, there would be no difficulty in assigning to him the honour
of this foundation. We must observe that Lug.‚ or Lugwdensis EpiscopuS, was not
the uniform style of Edan O’Kelley, Bishop of Clogher, since his name is given as a
witness to the charter of the monastery of Newry, as Bishop of Ergalia, or Uriel.—
Ware’s Bishops For Edenigmo, in the list of witnesses, read Coemgino.

A procur-acione et apodiciom mea.--Procuracio may be considered as the Latin for
coskerinq, the exaction of lodging and provision for himself and his retinue, laid by the
chief lord on his tenants and others under his protection. Expedicio probably compre-
hended not only the obligation of military service, but the bonaylzt, or exactione, im·
posed for the maintenance of the chieftain's horsemen or kearns.—Adelung’s Du
Gange in vocibus, and Harris’s Ware, chap. xii.

Canonium-um vel monachorum—The old foundations in Ireland were exclusively for
canons, and until the foundation of Mellifont by Malachy in 1 142, Ireland was, in the
words 'of St. Bernard, “ terra jain insueta immo et inexperta monastice religionis„—
Ποσει-ἐτ’ Sylloge, p. 10 ς. These canons were Coenobites, bound by some of the various
rules mentioned in Irish Ecclesiastical History, and were merged by Innocent IL,
1 139, in the canons Regular of St. Augustine. For the strong resemblance of the
Ganons of' St. Augustine with the Culdees, see Liber Cartarum Prioratus Sancti
