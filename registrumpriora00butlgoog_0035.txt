year 1474, passed in a Parliament held in Dublin, reciting, that
Richard, Abbot of St. Thomas, near Duhh'n‚ and William, Prior of
All saints, near Dubh‘n, and their convente, had much lands within
the habitation of the In'sh enemieS, and enacting that they might
send and carry, as well victuals as other necessaries‚ to the said Irish,
and might let to sarm and sell the profits of their possessions to them,
as often as they pleased‚ and might treat and be conversant with them,
as well in war as in peace, and that they might be godfathers to such,
without any offence or hreach of law⁸. In fact the lands situated
beyond the English marches were either to be given up altogether,
or were to be maintained by friendly dealings with those, who were
styled in parliamentary language, Irish enemies ; that such dealings
were frequent, even in time of war, chiefly through the intervention
of these great religious corporations, is proved by many existing re-

necessity of suing out a license from the Lieutenant, and from the
legal extortion of informers and officials,

Hallows was not backward 111 complying with this laudable custom ;

and such is the meagreness of our information respecting our Priory‚
after the termination of the Registry in the middle of the fifteenth
century, that we are tempted to mention, that on the 2 3rd of July,
