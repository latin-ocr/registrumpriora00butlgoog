natives as he would count up his stock⁸3 but as servi, these Mackeli-
gans were in a worse state than betaghs or natives; so far as is in-
dicated by this charter they were absolute slaves», and, as they were
given without land, might be removed or sold from it.

In the' early charters the grant of a turbary at Finglas², where
turs might be dug for the supply of all the houses of the priory, and
the condition in the grant of forty shilh‘ngs of annual rent in Manh-
thonin‚ in the tenement of Arclob, that it should be exchanged for
equal charge on land nearer to Dublin‚ are worthy of observation.

These grants were in pure alms ‘⁴ pro salute animarum,'’ or the
rent was only nominal and illusory‚ a rose, or a pair of spurS, or a
pound of pepper3 but a change now took place. The fervour of re-
ligious zeal‚ which the monks and canons had diverted to themselveS,
from older and now almost forgotten institutione, was directed
towards the Mendicant Orders in the thirteenth century, and the
followers of St. Benedict and St. Augustine gave way to those of St.
Francis and St. Dominick.

The subsequent grants then were of a different kind, and were
more in the nature of sales or of perpetual leaseS. Of these one of
the earliest and most interesting is that of Waleranc de Welleslegh,
who grants fifty acres in his tenement of Crewath, with the lordship
and feudal service of the ten acres held by John Wodeloo⁶‚ together
with the common pasture of the whole mountain, in wood and tur-
bary,
of Canterbury which he held in 8111161- “ &och—Al. Reg. p. 549. ·
