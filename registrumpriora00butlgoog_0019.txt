bishop, provided he were in the grace and communion of the Holy
Roman See, and at the same time, the erection of new chapels and
oratories within their parish‚ without their consent, and that of
- their diocesan, was prohibited

To these privileges in 1 276 Innocent V. added a protection
against new and undue exactions by archbishops, bishOPS‚ arch-
deacOns, or deanS, and all other personS, ecclesiastieal and secular,
and this Pope specially noted, that the Church of All Saints had no
abbot, but was under the government of a prior. These are nearly
the usual clauses and privileges contained in Bulls of this period, and
they ar'e here mentioned, not for any peculiarity in their contente,
but as specimens of the exemptions and immunities sought for by
religious houses in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The other
Bulls here printed are short, and expressed in general terms.

The superiority over the Priory os St. Saviour of Glendalough,
one of the earliest of the acquisitions of All-Hauows‚ was one of the
most interesting3 however great was t'he old sanctity of Glendalough,
it was now desert and desolate, a den of thieves and robbers'3 and
the Archbishop of Tuam* bore testimony that, in the forty years pre·
vious to 1 214, more homicides were committed in that valley than in
any other place in Ireland. ln the Synod of Mellifont in 1 152, which
was attended by Gilda na Naomh, then Bishop of Glendalough‚ Car-
dinal Paparo had divided this see, and had assigned part of it to
the metropolitan see of Dublin, which, till that time, was confined

within the walls of the city, intending, as the Archbishop of Tuam
believed,

bishop within their monasterieS, and of crilege perpetrated at Glendalough during
the readiness with which they svailed the abbacy of Archbishop Laurence, see
themselves for such purposes of the aid of Vita S. Laurentii, cc. 7, 8, apud Mes-

any foreign bishop, see many instances singham.
