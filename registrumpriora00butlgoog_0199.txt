Mon. Hib. 162, 21 1. In 1288, Archbishop John de Ssmforde, with the assent of the

Roberto de Lyrna—The right form of this name, which was of great distinction for
at least two generations, is now uncertain. In Mon. Hib. p. 156, in two paragraphs in
immediate successim, we have Gilbert de Yvet and Gilbert de Livet. In this Registry
it appears as De Lynet and Del Ynet. In the commencement of the reign of Edward II.
the De Lynets were a power-ful family in the south of Ireland. Rot. Can. Pat. 3 and 4
Edward II. 59, 72. Gilbert del Ynet is said, in Mon. Hib. p. 188, to have been mayor
of Dublin about the year 1212.

Theobaldus Walter-i.—As this grant is witnessed by J.‚ Bishop of Ferns from 1223
to 1 243, it must be assigned, as is done by Archdall, Peerege, vol. iv. p. 5, to the second
Theobald Walter. Is it not from the circumstance, that the first Theobald was brother
to Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canta-bury, that the tradition originated os the
connexion between the family of Ormonde and Archbishop Thomas ὲ Becket ⁴? Arch-
dall, vol. iv. p. 3. This grant is recited and confirmed in No, ix.
