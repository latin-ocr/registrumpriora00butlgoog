The loyalty of the citizens of Dublin during the siege of Thomas
Fitzgerald equalling in courage, if not equalling in the importance
of its results, the defence of their predecessore against the attack
of Robert and Edward Bruce, was rewarded with the spoils of
All Hallows. On the 4th of February, 1539, the King granted to
the Mayor‚ Bailiffs‚ citizens, and commons of Dublin‚ the Priory, with
all its lands and advowsonS, as they had been surrendered by Prior
Hancoke, for the annual payment of 34. 48. offd„ as the twentieth
part of the value. '

This noble grant was not long held by the Corporation in their
own hands. On 7th of August, 1 5 39, they leased¹¹¹ the whole of it
for six yearS, to Nicholas Stanyhurst‚ of Dublin‚ gentleman, and to
Walter Forester‚ of the same, clerk, at the rent of five score pounds
sterling.

The work of demolition was now going on. In this lease‚ although
Stanyhurst was bound to keep up and repair the Bystas and gate-
house next the Hogge’s-green, the stone waUS, porter's loge, and leaves
of the same gate, and to uphold the roos thereos, it was covenanted‚
that the tenants should make no claim to the stone work, stone walls,
towers, slates, and timber, “ that is at this present day there unsold
within the precinct of the said House ofAJJ SaintS,” and that it should be
lawful to the Corporation to dispose of them, and to convey them away.

Mr. D'Alton mentions an inquisition of 1 548, by which All Hal—
lows was found to have been seized of the nunnery or cell of Lusk,
which, having been appropriated to the Priory, was afterwards trans-
ferred to Grace Dieu.—Hist. of Co. of Dublin‚ 420-42 3. The
