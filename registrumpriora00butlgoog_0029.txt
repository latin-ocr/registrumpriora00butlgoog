doned a fine, on the grounds of poverty, a plea again used for the
like purpose in 1396; and in 142 3¹, according to the statement of the
CanonS, confirmed by Archbishop Talbot, the priory was reduced to
such a state of mise1y¹¹¹‚ by the rain of its buildings, by the unjust
and hostile occupation of its lande, by the unfruitfulness of the
seasonS, by the mortality of men and cattle, and by the number of
strangers, and other oppressione, that their remaining goods were
scarcely sufficient to support the prior and the convent, so that Di-
vine worship, the observance of the rule, and other works of piety,
could no longer be maintained without the relaxation of two marks
of the six payable to the archbishop for proxieS.
In 1374 the prior was summoned to Parliament'. It was in
1 380, when the priory was smarting from loss of property and sinking
into

Walter de Islep‚ clerk, for his good ser-
vices, an annual pension of five marks for
life, the said Walter binding himself to give
his advice, help, and assistance, against
all persons whatsoever, those alone ex-
eepted to whom he was bound before the
present agreement. Mon. Hib. from King’s
MSS. p. 286.

¹¹² Misery—In these circumstances the
leases of the property in the city and
suburbs of Dublin, where rents could al-
ways be collected, were earefully regis-
tered and preserved, and clauses of various
kinds were inserted in them. In some it
was conditioned that if the lessee wished
to sell the lands demised, or to put them
in pawn, the first offer was to be made to
the priory. In one sor forty years, provi-
ded the tenant's life should last so long, a

power was granted to the tenant to take

away any trees he might plant on any land
reclaimed by him from a mill-pond. In
another, right of re—entry is secured on
the rent being one mouth in arrear. In
another, right of seizure for rent was
given on another tenement, if sufficient
distress was not found on the premises.
In most of them the tenant is bound to
repair the buildings, and to deliver them
up “ stiff and staunch'’ at the end of his
term. In one the rent was reduced one·
half for forty years, in consideration of
the expensas of the tenant in repaire and
buildings. We have also the purchase, or
perhaps the repurchase, by the priory of
the remaining portion of a lease of forty
acres at Donnybroke, of which some years
had expired—N os. XXIII. IV. VIII.
