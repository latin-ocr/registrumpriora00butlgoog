obtained the privilege of eleeting annually their Seneschal and ProvostS. (D’Al-
ton’s Drogheda, vol. i. p. 15 1). At this time the Probi of this grant were probably
analogous to the commone, and the Discreti viri to the Aldermem of other corpora-
tions. It would seem, alm, that there was no seal belonging to the body. Henry
Macgormon may have been the possessor of Gormanstown‚ which the Prestons after-
wards aequired from Sir Almarie de St. Amand. It is evident‚ from this charter, that
the jurisdiction of the Probi of Drogheda extended into the adjacent district. The
