Liberos et absoluta—The distinction between the freeman and the villein was main·
tained by the Church ς and none but freeborn or enfranchised men were admissible
into religious foundations. It would seem, however, that a more benignam: and liberal
practice made its way, and that the nobles, who thereby lost the services of their vil-
leinS, were induced to enact laws against the admission of serfs or natives into holy
orders. The 16th Article of the Constitutions of Clarendon (1 164), asserts that, “ Filii

rusticorum non debent ordinari absque assensu domini de cujus terra nati esse dinos-
cuntur.” And in the 14th clause of the Statute of Kilkenny‚ for the publication of
which the antiquary and the historian are deeply indebted to Mr. Hardiman‚ it is
enacted: “ Que nul prelatz de St. Esglise recoievent nulle neoyff (i. e. native or vil·
lain, see Blackstone book ii. c. 6) as ascuns orders sanz assent et tesmoinnage de son
sesgnior faiet a luy sur son seale.” In the life of Robert Betun, Bishop of Hereford,

from 1 1 3 1 to 1 148 it. is said: “ Ordinationes clericorum exquisitissime faciebat . . . .
Gyravagoe, acephalos, notabiles, alienOS, servos penitus refutabat. Clericulos nisi pro—
vectiores et libertatis testimonium habenteS, quibusque in ecclesia locus et victus pro-
visus fuisset, coronare devitabat-”-Anqlia Sacra, vol. ii. p. 3 10.

Interdictum.—The following record, taken from Alan’s Reg. p. 410, Trinity College
copy, refers to an Interdict laid on the city of Dublin by Archbishop Fulk de Saun-
sord, in the year 1267:

“ Octobonus miseracione divina Sancti Adriani cardinalis Apostolice sedis Legatus
venerabilibus in Christo patribus Lismorensi et waterfordensi episcopis salutem in
salutis auctore. Horrendam nimis piis sensibus auribusque nostris valde molestam
