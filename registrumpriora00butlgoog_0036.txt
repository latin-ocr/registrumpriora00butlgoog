1488, Sir Richard Edgcomb⁰‚ who had been sent to Ireland as the
King’s Commissioner‚ after the general declaration of the AngloIrish
in favour os Lambert Simnel‚ had an interview with the Earl of
Kildare‚ at a place of Canons called All Hallows‚ without Dublin,
and there had long communication with him and his Council, and
that day, at after dinner, the said Sir Richard rode to Drogheda‚
twenty-four miles thence3 and the same parties had another confe-
rence at All Hanws, on the 29th of the same month.

In 1490, in a Parliament held at Drogheda, and thence adjourned
to Dublin, before Gerald Earl of Kildare, deputy to J aspar Duke of
Bedforss Lieutenant of Ireland‚ Prior William (probably through the
influence of the Deputy, the hereditary friend of All Hallows), ob·
tained a privilege, indicating the unhappy circumstances of the country.
Stating‘¹ that his convent was grievously charged with diverse sub-
sidies‚ taxes, talliages‚ and grants, made as well by authority of Par-
]iament as by that of the Great Council, and also with other impo—
sitions laid upon them for great and little hostings (⁴⁶ grand jornaiez
et petuz’')‚ he obtained an Act, exempting him and his house for
ever and their possessions in every county‚ barony, and deanery in
Ireland, from all subsidies, taxes, talliage8‚ and from all impositions
granted to the King‚ or to any governor of the land, on the payment
of 1 33. 4d. to be levied from the lands of Baldoyle, by the coUector
of the deanery of Swords. By this Acte were also confirmed all
grants made to All Hallows by Edward IV., any Act or ordinance

made or to be made notwithstanding. The
