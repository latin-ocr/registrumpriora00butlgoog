believed, that it should be united with Dublin on the next vacancy.
In 1 1 92 Earl John', by a charter dated at N ottingham on the Feast
of St. John the Evangelist‚ granted to John Comyn the privilege
of nominating the Bishop of Glendalough, who was to be chaplain
and vicar to the archbishop. He had previously, when in Dublin2‘,
granted the see itself to Archbishop John, ‘⁴ pro raritate populi et
paupertate Ecclesie Dublin;’' but perhaps the insolence of the Irish,
to use Archbishop Felix O’Ruadan’s worda, may have deferred the
execution of this plan, although it was confirmed by Matthew⁸, Arch-
bishop of Cashel, the Pope’s Legate; it is, however, probable that
William Pir0, the last recognizedb Bishop of Glendalough, was ap-
pointed under this charter, in 1 192, by Archbishop Comyn.

Pope Innocent ΙΙΙ., to whom John had sent the Archbishops of
Bourdeaux, York‚ and Dublin, as ambassadors for the purpose, con-
firmed the union of the sees in 1 216, on condition that, with part of
the revenues of the see of Glendalough, a religious house or hos-
pitalc should be erected3 and accordingly Archbishop Henry de
Loundres founded near the Priory of All-HaIIOWS, on the sea-shore,
which was called the Steyn, an hospital where pilgrims on their way

to St. J ames of Compostella, who might be detained by stress of
weather‚ should find bed and board3 and he endowed there ten

chaplainS, who were to wear black cloaks with a white cross on
the breast.

While the old Irish City of Glendalough in the mountains, se-
cured only by its situation, and hallowed by ancient custom, was
gradually giving way‘¹ before its modern and Danish rival, the seat of
