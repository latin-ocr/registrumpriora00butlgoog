Mauricio Maclz M urucla.-.This charter exhibits a mixture, unhappily too rare, of
Irish and English nameS. The Fitz-Williams and the De Beaufos are seldom found

with the Mac DermotS, Mac Moroughs‚ and Mac Donoghs.

Tkoma de Wyncestr.-In a Pipe RolL 44, 5 Hen. ΙΙΙ., engraved in Record Report i.
Pl. ii. p. 56, several of the names attached to this and the following grente, appear as
witnesses : Walter Unred‚ Symon Unred‚ Reymond PictavenS, Thom. de Wynton
(winchester), Elyas Burel, and Rich. Olof. In this year, 12 59-60 (and also in 1267,
Chain Book), Vincent Taverner was mayor, and Walter Unred and Hugh Cissor (Tailor)
were provostS.

Robert de Nottingham rightly appears as mayor in that famous year, in which he de-
fended Dublin from the Scots. Geram also, the grantor‚ witnesses No. xxiii„ which
was probably granted about the year 1 2 30.

In, Thenymothe.- This word seems to mean the Thingmote, or place of legal
assembly in the Danish times of Dublin. See Gloss. Du Gange in voce Thingare. St.
Andrew’s chureh and churchyard were the site of the present Castle Μαι-1101, and so
