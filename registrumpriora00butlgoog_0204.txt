Michaelis de la Pol.-Stanyhurst‚ ubi supra, calls this chureh St. Michael’s of
Poules‚ alias Paules. From the two following leases it would appetu* that this perish
was situated near St. Patrick’s cathedraL In 1682 the perishes of St. Bride and St.
Michael of Pole, and a pert of St. Stephen’s, were united by act of Council, and this
chureh was used as the diocesan school-house. In 1706 the Chapter issued an order to
Dr. John J ones thet he should not pull down the monument or tower of St. Michael
of Paul’s‚ near his school—house in Sheepe-streen—Mason, 72. Archdall‚ Mon. Hib.
p. 150, says that Le Pullestreet, in the parish of St. Brigid‚ is now called Ship-street;
but this is inconsistent with the earlier authority of Stanyhumt, wh0, p. 26, in his
enumeration of the streets of Dublin, mentions both the Poule, or Paulmil-street, and
the Sheepe-streeu alias Ship-street; he also states that the Poule gete bridge was re·
paired by N icholas Stanyhurst about the year one thousand five hundred foui-ty and
four. During the assault of the N orwegians on the English occupiers of Dublin,
Hei-rie, in his History of Dublin, p. 224, says, Richard de Cogan, by direction of his
brother, sallied out of the south gete (then called Pole gete, at the end of St. Wer-
burgh-street) with a body of 300 horse, and ettacked the enemy in flank. In the
original the gete from which this victorious attack was made is called the west gete,
and the 300 horse are reduced to 30.—Conquest of Ireland‚ 2341. In Hib. Expug.
Dist. 1. c. xxi„ Giraldus says that Richard Cogan sellied out per porticum australem.
Curious etymologica are suggested by the name of the Norwegian leader : Regan
calls him J ohan le Deve, and Gir-aldus styles him J ohannes Thewoode, quod latine
sonat insanus vel valterum. Have we here the origin of the Scottish word Deam, and

the old English Wood?

Ricardo Otos majora—As the names of R. 0101: Thomas Wynchester‚ and Roger
Ashbourne, frequently occur as witnesses to many undated granta, it is of some impor-

tance to ascertain the year in which Olof was mayor, and Wynchester and Ashbourne
