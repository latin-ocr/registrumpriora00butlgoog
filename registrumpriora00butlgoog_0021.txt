trade and foreign intercourse, and while its bishops os the succession

os St„ Patrick were supplanted by the Dublin archbishops of the suc-
cession of St. Augustine, the fate os its abbeys was not dissimilar. At
the time of the foundation of the Priory of All-Hallows‚ Coemgin or
Kevin was Abbot of Glendalough‚ and his name appears amongst
the witnesses of Dermod's charter. Having become vacant, probably
by Coemgin's death, Strongbow conferred the abbey and personage,
‘⁶ Abbati& et Parsonatus'’ of Glendalough, with all its great posses-
sions and immunities, as they were specified to him in verbo veritatis
by King Dermod, on his dear clerk Thomasf, in a charter witnessed
by the Countess Eva and confirmed by Henry II.g

This grant was not long observed. Earl John, by a charter dated

at Tewkesbury¹¹‚ granted to the Archbishop of Dublin half a cantred

Athcliath, qui modo dicitur Dublinia,

Abbot Laurence spent the great riohes

of the abbey, and a treasure deposited
with him by his father, ‘⁴ pauperibus
nutriendis et ecclesiis aedificandis·”—- Vita
S. Laur. cap. 9. Are there now any re-
mains of the churches built by him at
Glendalough?

(Eccl. Hist. vol. iv. p. 181) has questioned
this appointment of Abbot Thomas by
Strongbow, and has attributed the grant
to Richard de Burgo in 1227. But the
deed is by Strongbow‚ stating what King
Dermod had told hm, and it is confirmed,
not by Henry ΙΙΙ. but by Hem-y IL
