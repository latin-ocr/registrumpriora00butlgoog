severities of the Feudal system must have been much sostened when
it was administered by the easy and formal churchman‚ connected by
blood more frequently with the middle ranks than with the nobles
of the land.

Perhaps the most startling grant in this collection is the con-
cession and donation by Richard de Pheypou, of certain serf5‚ with all
the issue and progeny of their sept. From the name Mackelegan,
and from their being said to be of Balydugyl‚ it is likely that these
men were the descendants of the Melisu Macfeilecan‚ of Balydub-
gil, wh0‚ with his descendente, was granted to the priory in King
Dermod's charter. They are here given separate from the land, and as
pure serfs or “ villeinsv in gross‚’' not as neoyffsw, betaghs‚ or ascripti
yleboe. The difference between these forms of villeinage was con-
siderable3 the betagh or native was an occupier of the land, bound
to the performance of certain offices connected with land3 he was
bound to the land and granted with it; he was obliged to bear tal-
liage¹‚ high and low, at the will of the lord3 his right to dispose by
will os his chatel] property was denied in the King’s Courts3 and
even were he to raise himself to the rank of a citizen of Dublin,
any landed property which he acquired was liable to be seized
upon by the lord. In this form villeinage existed in heland to the
sixteenth century& when Archbishop Alan, in 153 1, counts up his
