The fate of the site of this Priory has been happier than that of
most other religione houses. In 1592, on the 2 1st day os July, it was
made over by Thomas Smythe, Mayor of Dublin‚ George Kennedy
and John MilleS, Sheriffs, the commons and citizens of the city, to
Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin‚ Chancellor of ,Ireland, Provost
of the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity‚ near Dublin‚
founded by Queen Elizabeth, and to the Fellows and Scholars of the
said college, for their use and that of their successore for ever, The
old buildingS, if any still remained, were speedily demolished, except
the steeple3 and a college, the forerunner of that noble building, to
which so many now look with filial affection, was erected in their
place. It was seven hundred years ago dedicated to God, and it is
still intended for his service—May it be so always 1
