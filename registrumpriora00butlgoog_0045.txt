land‘. This is a simple and natural arrangement3 it is not easy to
suppose that in an ecclesiastical Registry any documents took prece·
dence of the Papal Bulls3 and as Archbishop Talbot’s¹¹ relaxation
immediately precedes the confirmation of Pope Gregory³, it is plain
that our present manuscript contains all the Bulls os the original
compilation. It is, indeed, possible that charters and other evidences
of the connexion of the Priory with the Archbishops os Dublin‚ who
were not only the ordinaries, but the patrone of the house, may have
had the first place in our Registry‚ and that, instead of a subsequent
insertion, Archbishop Talbot's Relaxation may have been the last of
a series of such documents. On this matter it is impossible to speak
decisively‚ but we are of opinion that the original compilation com-
menced with our Nc. 1.‚ and continued in the order of the following
pages, until it closed with N0.LXXXV111.‚ and that the numbers
which follow in this collection were added amongst the original com-
pilation, according to the caprice of the transcribere.

Although the misplacing of onej of the Papal bulls, and the mis-
dating of others¹, and the strong suspicion of at least one graver
error¹‚ prevent implicit reliance on the learning and care of the com·
piler of the Register, yet of the general accuracy of the record there
is the most satisfactory evidence. Not only is there a copy of the
deed of Richard Chamberleyn to be found in the Charter Book of
the Corporation of Dublin¹n in the same words with our N ο. XXIX.‚
but we have in some instances been enabled to test the accu-
