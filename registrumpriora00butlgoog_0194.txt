In the Synod of Cashel it was ordained that the dead man should have the third
of his moveables3 and this rule was observed in the time of Archbishop Tregury. The
following extract from Laing’s Chronicle of the Kings of N orvmy, shews the antiquity
of this custom, and the mode in which this part was disposed of amongst some of
the northern pagane: “ Thorer explained, that it was so established in this land
(near the mouth of the Dwina river), that when a rich man died, all his moveable
goods were divided between the dead man and his heirs. He got the half part, or
the third part, or sometimes less, and that part was carried out into the forest and

buried—sometimes under a mound‚ sometimes in the earth, and sometimes even a
house was built over it.”-VoL ii. p. 200.

rare occurrence. There seem to be some faint indications that priories of a founda-
tion anterior to the middle of the thirteenth century, were originally immediately
under resident episcopal authority. Malachy, Bishop of Down from 1 1 76 to 1201,
granted the church of St. Patrick of Down in these words: ‘⁴ Sciant futuri tanquam
presentes quod ego Malachias Dunensis Episcopus concessi ad honorem Dei et sancte
religionis ecclesiam S. Patricii de Dune cum omnibus pertinentiis suis ad opus prioris
et nigrorum monachorum, quorum ipse episcopus ero custos et abbas, sicut fit in ’
ecclesia Wyntoniensi vel conventrensi.”—-Mon. Anyl. vol. ii. p. 1020. For the abbatial

authority of the Bishop of winchester over the monks of St. Swithun Wynton, see
