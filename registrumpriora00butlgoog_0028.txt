The times were now coming when the lands in the immediate
neighbourhood of Dublin, although not the most extensive, would be
the most valuable possessions of the priory. With short-sighted
policy¹‚ Edward the First had wasted the fiower of the Anglo·Irish
nobles in the wars of Gascony and Scotland, while, with unusual
weaknesS, to secure their favour, he had resisted his own wish to
consolidate his power in Ireland, and to attach the natives to his
government by extending over all the protection and the authority of
English law, and by abrogating altogether those Irish customs‚ which
were still recognized in his courts. It is not strange then, that the
nativeS, who had in vain sought the shelter of the throne from the
oppression of their petty tyr-anta, should have taken advantage of
the missortunes of Edward II. and should have been encouraged to
resistance by the success os the Scots. Nor is it strange that, having
no one great man to guide them, and no principle of union to raise
their discordant septs to the feeling of national independence‚ they
should have satisfied at once their vengeance and their cupidity by
predatory attacks on the property of the English, by burning their
homesteadS, by driving away their cattle, and finally by enter-ing into
possession of the landa, which they had made worthless to the occu-
piers. In this general lawlessneSS, the priory must have found great
difficulty in establishing its rights in its remoter estates; as early as
1305, we find the prior complaining of a rescue of distresses which
had been made in the fee of TipperaryJ, andin 1318k he was par-
