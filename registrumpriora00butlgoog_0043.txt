the family of MolyneuX, with Dr. John Maddeffl, in whose collection
of manuscripts our Registry was probably contained, when that col-
lection was purchased by the learned and munificent Bishop Stearne'3
(to ‘the Irish antiquary it is pleasant to connect' these names.) Bishop
Stearne bequeathed his manuscripts⁸to the Library of Trinity College,
and there, on the site of the old Priory, the Registry¹ of All Hallows
is safely deposited.

The manuscript is on vellum, and consists of sixty·three leaves,
each 9‡ inches in length, by 42} in breadth, with margins about an
inch broad; a full page contains about twenty-eight lines. The titles
of the Bulls and other documents are in Rubric. Although now
nearly illegible, from the fading of the ink, it is written in a neat and
uniform hand of the fifteenth century, and was compiled between the
year 142 5—the latest date mentioned in any of the charterSV—-and
the year 1460, the date of the return made by the Archdeacon of
Ferns to the mandate of the bishop of that diocese, respecting a pre·
sentation to the vicarage of Rathmackne², which is written in a more
recent hand, on the back of folio 3. That the volume is now nearly
as perfect as it was three centuries ago appears from the following
memorandum on the back of folio 41: ‘⁶ Iste liber continet sexaginta
