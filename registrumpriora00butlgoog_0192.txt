it is enjoined, ‘⁴ ut omni anno decimas de vitalibus et mortalibus Deo demus, cum
omni anno ipsius munera habeamus ;’' but that of the fruits of the earth, the tithe is
to be given only in that year in which they grow3 when a person had less than ten
of any article, there seemed, in the time of this Synod, to have been some doubt as to
the proper mode of tithing3 some asserting that in such case no tithes need be paid3
others enjoining, that if 8 man had only one cow, he should divide the price into ten
parts, and give the tenth to God. In the treatise De Statu Ecclesiae, written by Gilberu
Bishop of Limerick and Legate, about the year 1 100, are these words, shewing the
payment of tithes», and the persons to whom they were paid in Ireland at that time:
“ Octo sunt ergo quibus sustentatur sacerdos, parochia, mansus, atrium, coemiterium,
templum, altare, calix cum patena, corpus cum sanguine, ....... Parochiam appello
populum primitias oblationes et decimas persolventem, Mansum dico terram aratri
quam ed minus debet habere sacerdos ς Atrium, cum domibus suis clausuram„—
Usserii Vet. Epp. Hib. Sylloye, p. 8 5. It is probable, however, from the frequent re-
petition of orders for their payment by cardinal Paparo in 1 157 (see the Annals of
Cluain Aidnsch, in Keating, vol. ii. p. 276), at the Council of Cashel in 1 172, in which,

’ however, the canon applies not to the payment of tithes, but to their appropriation to

the parish church (see Hibernia Expug. lib. i. 0. 30), and by Archbishop Comyn in 1 1 86
(see Harris’s Ware’s Bishops, p. 3 17), as well 88 from the assertion of Giraldus Cam·
brensis--wh0‚ however, mixes this charge with others which, as Irishmen, we should
not willingly allow (Top. Hib. Distinc. iii. c. 19)—that there 1188 some difficulty in en-
forcing these canons of the Church, and in establishing this custom. In the fifteenth
century it was a usual practice for dying men in their last wills toleave a sum of money
to the parson of the parish, pro decimis oblitis,· of this several instances are to befound
in Archbishop Tregury’s Registry of Wills, which is preserved in the Library of Trinity
coll. Dub.; and in the same volume are given several sentences of excommunication
pronounced against contumacious withholders os tithe in the diocese of Dublin ; and
if contumacious for forty day8, the excommunicated person was committed to prison.
Except in the payment of the quarter episcopale to the bishops in Connaught (see
Harris’s Ware's Bishops, p. 619), I have not found the slightest mention of any threefold
or fourfold apportionment of the tithes in Ireland‚ either by law 01· custom. The term
of forty days previous to the arrest of the excommunicated person (Rot. CL ii. H. 3, in
Turr. Lond., and Proceedings against Alice Kyteler‚ p. 20) was reduced to a month by
the first chapter of the Statute of Kilkenny.

· The following Β11Π relative to tithes has not been printed. It was addressed by

Innocent the Third, in 1 2 14, to Archbishop Henry de Loundres:
“ Innocentius Episcopus servus servorum Dei venerabili fratri Archiepiscopo
Dublin salutem et Apostolicam benedicionem. significasti nobis quod plerique per
Hiberniam
