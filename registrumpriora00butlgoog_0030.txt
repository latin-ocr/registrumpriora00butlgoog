writ⁹ of Richard ΙΙ. ordering the observance of the enactment in the
Statute of Kilkenny, that no Irishman‚ or any enemy of the king,
should be admitted into any religious house within the land of Ire-
land. Recourse had often been had before, by both sideS, to this
unhappy proof of national discord. So early as 1 2 50 Pope Innocent
IV.‘¹ sent a Bull to the Irish bishopS‚ ordering them to revoke a
Statute which they had made, “ ex quodam livore‚'' that no English—
man should be received into their religious houses as a canon: and
while the Irish Abbot of Mellifont' refused to admit any monk unless
he made oath that he was not os English descent, and the Irish
Abbot of Magio⁸ [Mayo] alienated the lands of his abbey with a view
to prevent English monks from dwelling there, the English monks of
Granardt and of Iniscourcy, of the same Order (they were all Cis·
tercians), buckled on their armour and attacked and killed the Irish,
and then returned to celebrate Mass .

The writ of Richard II. was directed to twenty-one religious
houses; although not repealed by authority, it was not long observed3 ι
like many other laws it ‚was silently reversed when the passion in
which it originated had given place to the common feelings of hu·
manity. The names of some of the Subsequent abbots in these
