Meath, of which we find no further mention. It was also about this
time that Theobald Fitzwalter‘‚ second butler of Ireland, granted to
the priory two acres and a half of his land of Steyn near to their
house, with all the tithes and offerings of the whole Steyn3 and that
John, son of John, son of Dermic‘, confirmed his father's grant of a
boat for catching salmon and other fish on the Liffey‚ for which he
was to receive a rose on every St. John Baptist's day, in the Church
of All-Hallows3 and it was probably about the same time that Clari-
cia‘, daughter of Gilbert‚ son of Griffin‚ granted half a carucate of
arable land in Balyofryn next to the land of Sir John Harold of
Kylgabane (Kilgobbin), with pasture on the mountains for as many
cattle as the canons chose, with liberty to pasture, dig, cut, and with

all other privilegeS, which the grantor possessed or could give. ,
Such were the grants of parishes and of lands which the priory
thought worthy of Papal confirmation in the year 1 276. In these
and the other grants of the same period, there is proof—in the men-
tion of homage, wardshiPS, suits of court, and marriage—that the
Norman settlers brought with them into Ireland all the complexities
of the feudal system3 a system eminently fitted, by the strictness
and frequency of its legal relatione, by the minute divisions of its
ever present authority, by the nearness of its administrators‚ and by
the variety and succession of its dependencies‚ to discipline a rude
people by the introduction of notione of right and of lavv‚ and by
familiarizing them with legal forms and ceremonies. Nor, when we are
considering a great ecclesiastical lordship‚ should we forget that the
