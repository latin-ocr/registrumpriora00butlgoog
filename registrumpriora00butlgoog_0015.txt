 

the King, the Irish princes, for the first time, tasted heron's flesh,
and where they were astonished at the elegant abundance of an
English feast, and the order and obsequiousness of the attendants,
The priory was not without benefit from this neighbourhood of
royalty3 it was at this time, that, in the presence of Archbishop Law-
rence, of the original patron Bishop Edan, of Strongbow‚ Hugh de
Lacy, Robert Poer, and other3‚ that Henry ΙΙ. confirmed the grants
of Baldoyle and of several other lands, made by Dermod, of which
the original charters are not recorded. This preservation of their
property seems to have been a special favour to this house. It might
have been expected that, to conciliate the Irish ecclesiastice, King

Henry and his immediate successors would have preserved at least
the landed property¹ of the Irish Church‚ united by the Council of

¹ Landedpropmy.-The property of the
ancient Irish Church consisted of other

things besides lande and tithes. J ocelin
tells us, in words shewing the trade and
business of Dublin: ‘⁴ Statuerunt ergo
[cives Dubliniae] reditum S. Patricio suo
Patrono ς videlicet de singulis navibus
mercimoniabilibus cappam competentem

Although the buildings were destroyed
and the religious dispersed, the property
of the Irish Church was preserved during
*all the troubles consequent on the Danish

Cashel,

invasion. St- Bernard (Vita Malachiae, cap.
v.) says that from the destruction of the
Abbey of Benchor (Bangor) by the Danes‚
to the time of Malachy, its property fell into
the hands of persons who where appointed
by election, and who were called abbots,
‘⁴ servantes nomine, etsi non re, quod olim
extiterat.” This passage must have been
overlooked by Dr. Lanigan‚ when he al-
lowed (vol. iv. p. 2 5) that Gille, Bishop of
Limerick in 1 1 10, and Apostolic Legate,
had been Abbot of Benchor. The names
of some of the abbots thus described by St.
Bernard, are given in Archdall, from good
authorities, without any distinctive marks.

It would appear from the following
passage in the Tripartite Life of St. Pa-
trick, that at the time it was written,
which has not been thought to be later
than the tenth century, the custom of
