the first of these Acts the title of William ( Stewnot)‚ Prior of All
Sainta was confirmed to all wrecks on the manor of Baldowell‚ en—

in a Parliament held at ConaF, in the 18th of Edward IV„ enacts:

Dublin‚ lords of the town of Baldoile, that as the inhabitants of the town of
Baldoile, in county of Dublin‚ are daily troubled ἀ damaged in their goods
by the king's admirals of Ireland and their deputies, according to the law of
Ulron⁸, who daily levy inordinate amerccments on them, against all law and
conscience, to the great damage of said prior and convent. and the utter un-
doeing of said tenants ἀ inhabitants ; it is enacted that said prior ὅτ, his
successors shall, for the time to come, be admirals of said town and all other
their lands in Ireland‚ and shall enjoy the said office of admirals to them &
their assigns ἀ deputieS, without any molestation or impediment from the
king, his heirs or successors‚ officers or ministerS, ὅτ, that no other admiral
of the king or his deputy shall vex or trouble any of the said tenants δι in-
habitants, by virtue of their office, in time to come, ὅτ, whoever of them acts to

the contrary shall forfeit AElo, half to the king and half to the party grieved.'’

who in this year was joined in commission with the Arehbishop of
Dublin‚ and Earl of Kildare and others, to attend the King on par-
