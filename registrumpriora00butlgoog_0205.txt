ward, son osEdward‚ or Edward 11., 11101 is, the year 1 3 1 6 ς and 11101 this was the true date
of 0101· ’s mayoralty‚ would seem, in some degree, 10110 rendered probable by the circum-
stance that Richard de Sancto Olavo is said in Ware’s list to 110νο 110011 bailiff in 1308,
10, and 123 and in our Nc. xxxiii„ which is dated in 1347, the shop now recovered
being styled the shop recovered from Richard Ponteys, would seem to bring the trans-
0011011 01· 1110 present N 0. within the preceding fifty years. But there 010 31001 diffi-

culties in the way 01· fixing the mayoralty 01· 0101· and the provostship of Wynchester
and Ashbourne so 1010 as 1317.

From Nc. lxxvii„ p. 68, it appears 11101 Prior Nigellus was alive in 1288, and that
he was dead in 1²983 110 could not therefore have been plaintiff before Richard Olof in
1317. Nor is this the only difficulty in the way of this 1010 date of the present Nc.
