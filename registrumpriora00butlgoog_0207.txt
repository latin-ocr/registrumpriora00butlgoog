bebly was shortly before that year. The occurrence of R. Olof’s name in this con-

grexion harmonizes with our conjecture of the date of his mayoralty in the note to
o. κων.

Strongbow's grentee, Vivianus, is called De Cursun in Harris’s were, p. 190. If the
death of the second Meyler is rightly placed in the 27 Hen. 111„ this grant must have
been made before 1244, which would agree with the date, 1238, given in Mon. Hib„
p. 157, as the year of Pollard’s mayornlty. It is to be oboerved thet the mayor wit-

Cma Demuiciss—The authority of Dermod M‘Morough, king of Leinster, within
the city of Dublin, seems to have been uncertain and fluctuating. In this charter he
distinguishes the men of Dublin—a. body of commercia] foreignerS, struggling for in-
dependence—from the men of Leinster‚ his native and hereditery subjecte.

Edam.-Lugwdenei‚ or Lugudenei, aa printed by Dugdnle, Mon. Anglic, from
Sir J. Were’s transcript, has been always taken to mean Bishop of Louth or Clogher,
‚ a see at this time filled by Edan O’KeUey, who had been appointed to it in the room
of Christian, Melechy’s brother, by Malachy himself, because he new in a vision the
episcopal gold ring upon Edan’s finger. (Cambrensis Eversus, p. 168.) It is not
plain, however, that Dei-mod, king of Leinsten had any connexion with Louth, and it
is also difficult to eeaign a reason for his placing the Biehop of Clogher in Dublin. It
would be easy to read Lug„ the contractiori for this bishop’s title, in Ahn’s Registry
