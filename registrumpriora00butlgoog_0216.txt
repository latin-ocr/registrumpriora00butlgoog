part of Drogheda, on the North side of the Boyne, was called De Ponte ex parte Uriel‚
or, De Ponte Ferrardi, from its situation in the territory of Ferrard. In this North
part of Drogheda was situated the Franciscan Friary of Drogheda, where were com-
piled the Annals de Ponte Ferrardi, called hitherto Annales de Monte Fernandi, or the

Annals of Multifernam.—-See note following.

De Ponte—It would now be difficult to discover the reasons why the Annals in-
scribed “ Annales de Monte Fernandi,” were called the Annals of Multifernam.

There is no reason for believing that the Franciscan Friary of Multifernam was
ever called de Monte Fernandi, a name, which its situation in a low valley would ren-
der singularly inapplicable. Multifernam was founded by the Delaman, a name which
does not occur in the Annals de Monte Fernandi; and these Annals make frequent
mention ‘of families whom we cannot trace in the neighbourhood of Multifernam.
These obvious objections to the common title, and the frequent mention of the family
of Dexter, induced ware, and Usher, and Molyneux‚ to suspect that these Annals
were compiled in the Dominican Friary of Strade, in Mayo. This supposition would
do away altogether with the common title, and is inconsistent with the evidence con-
· tained in the Annals that they were the work of a Franciscan. By the change of only
two letters in the title all difficulties may be overcome. That part of Drogheda which
lies on the north side of the Boyne, in the Barony of Ferrard, was called De Ponte
Ferrardi, to distinguish it from the villa De Ponte on the south side of the river.—
D’Alton‚ vol. i. p. 146. On this, the north side of the Boyne, was situated the Fran-
ciscan Friary of Drogheda, and it may be assumed that this friary was called de Ponte
Fer-rudi, as long as the distinction between the two sides of the river was continued;
and that this name became obsolete when both boroughs were consolidated. If these
Annals were compiled in Drogheda, the frequent‘ and familiar mention of the Dextera,
the Lords of Stackallan (D’Alton‚ vol. i. p. 90), and the builders of Castle Dexter, and
the namers of Carrig Dexter, is easily accounted for3 and as the Dexters of Meath were
most probably connected with the Dexters or the J ordans of Connaught, the notioes of
Connaught affairs may be traced to the same origin. Although, for convenient reference,
these Annals may still be quoted as the Annals of Multisernan, by which name they
have been called by Ussher, ware, N icolson, and Smith, we think that their proper
title is “ Annales de Ponte Ferrardi,” and that the Franciscan Friary of Drogheda is
entitled to the honour of their compilation.
