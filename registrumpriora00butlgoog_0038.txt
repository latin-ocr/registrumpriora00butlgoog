lawful distress was therein‚ then the lessor was to repossess the landa.
The tenants were bound to keep the messuage and appurtenances

the Prior, under pain os forfeiture of the lease 3 and if the tenants

Richard ΙΙ. (ι 390), this condition was not
obser-ved, and that the heir of Sytrick was
an Irishman, and an enemy to the King.

It was subsequently found by a jury, that
the lands had been granted by Dermic
