The attention of Henry VII. was at last directed to the state of
Ireland, by the countenance shewn by the Yorkist party to the two
PretenderS, Simnel and Warbeck. For the encouragement of his
loyal subjects he granted eight marks‘ yearly to the guild in the
chapel of St. George the Martyr‚ in Dublin, an old Lancastrian
