Salva noba‘a--Various means were adopted to secure the regular performance of
divine service in the parishes appropriated to religious houses. Thus in Maurice Fitz-
Gerald’s grant of the parish of Taghadoe p. 16, the tithes, lands, and obventione, and
other things belonging to them, are carefully reserved to the church of Laderachbrim
(Laraghbrien)‚ and to the chapel of Maynooth ς and in this instance of the parish of
Rath, by reserving to himself the collation of the vicarage‚ the bishop not only secured
the appointment of a resident priest‚ but also prevented the collusive arrangement
which too often was made by religious houses with vicars of their own nomination.
