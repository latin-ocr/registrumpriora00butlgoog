quinque folia tam scripta quam non scripta, anno Domini 1 5 5 3, quo·
rum quinquaginta novem sunt scripta”⁸. Four of the leaves “ non
scripta'' remainb, so that, with the exception of two⁰leaves at the end,
which are now wanting, the manuscript is as perfect as it was in
1553& ‘

,Before that time, however, the first sixteen leaves of the original
manuscript were lost, for there are still visible on many of the leaves
the peculiar numerals of an older system of paging, by which the
present folio 1 was numbered folio 17. Notwithstanding this muti·
lation of the volume, we may hope that the original Registry is still
nearly complete. It is not- likely that in the early pageS, which have
been lost, any of the more ancient documents of the Priory were
contained; those pageS, probably, were partly occupied by a table of
contentS, such as is frequently prefixed to monastic chartularies3
'and partly they may have been left blank for future insertionS, like
the folia non scripta of the memorandum of 1 5 5 33 and from Arch-
bishop Talbot’s relaxation of two markS, payable for proxies, being
written on our folio 1, it is probable that these early folios were occu-
pied by records, to which priority was given, not from their higher
antiquity, but from their peculiar interest in the days of the compiler.
It is evident that the documents in the Registry have been arranged
according to a system, and this order haS, therefore, been preserved
in the following pages: first, there are Papal Bulls⁶‚ then Royal Con-
firmationse, then Charters and Leases relating to property within the

city of Dublin‘, followed by grants of lands in other parts of Ire—

land.
